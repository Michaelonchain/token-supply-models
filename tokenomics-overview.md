# Tokenomics Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of how tokenomics
supports long-term sustainability in Web3 projects.

The focus is not on price speculation, but on incentive alignment,
supply control, and predictable economic behavior.

## Key Components

### 1. Token Supply
Understanding total supply, circulating supply, and emission schedules
is critical for managing long-term inflation and dilution.

### 2. Incentives
Tokens influence behavior. Poorly designed incentives can encourage
short-term extraction instead of long-term participation.

### 3. Inflation & Emissions
Controlled emissions help balance network growth with value preservation.
Uncontrolled inflation often leads to loss of confidence.

### 4. Vesting & Distribution
Gradual vesting aligns contributors and investors with the project’s
long-term success.
