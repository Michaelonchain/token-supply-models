This repo demonstrates how I design and analyze token supply for early-stage Web3 projects.
🔹 Token Supply Models
A collection of common and advanced token supply mechanics used in Web3.

🚀 Overview

This repository explains and documents multiple token supply structures.
Different crypto projects use different supply models depending on their goals, utility, and long-term strategy.

This repo helps founders and developers understand which model fits their token best.

🧩 Types of Supply Models

1️⃣ Fixed Supply Model

Total supply is created once.

No new tokens are minted.

Common in meme coins and store-of-value tokens.


2️⃣ Inflationary Supply Model

New tokens are minted slowly over time.

Helps reward validators, stakers, or ecosystem growth.


3️⃣ Deflationary Supply Model

Token supply decreases through burns.

Creates scarcity over time.


4️⃣ Dynamic / Elastic Supply Model

Supply expands or contracts based on market conditions.

Used in algorithmic tokens and rebase systems.


5️⃣ Vesting & Distribution Models

Tokens released gradually to team, investors, community.

Protects the project from sudden dumps.

📁 Folder Structure

We will later add folders like:

/fixed
/inflationary
/deflationary
/elastic
/vesting

Each folder will contain explanations and examples.
