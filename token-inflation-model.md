📌 Token Inflation Model: Staking Rewards
# Token Inflation Model (Staking Rewards)

## 📌 Overview
This report explains how staking rewards influence token inflation, supply growth, and long-term holder incentives. It is designed to help Web3 projects optimize reward distribution without harming token value.

---

## 🟢 Why Do Projects Use Staking Rewards?
Staking rewards create:
- Higher **network security**
- More **long-term holders**
- Better **market stability**
- A reduction in **sell pressure**

---

## 📊 Types of Staking Inflation Models

| Model | Inflation Behavior | Best Use Case |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|
| Fixed Rate | Same % every year | Simple gov tokens |
| Dynamic | Adjusts with demand & TVL | DeFi protocols |
| Halving | Reduces over time | Long-term ecosystems |

---

## 🧮 Example Inflation Formula (Dynamic Model)
Reward = (Base Rate × Total Staked) ÷ Active Validators

- More staking **reduces** rewards → encourages balance.
- Fewer stakers **increases** rewards → attracts more participants.

---

## 🎯 Optimal Parameters for Sustainable Growth

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Annual Inflation | 5% — 12% |
| Max Supply Cap | Optional but recommended |
| Lock Period | 7 — 90 days |
| Reward Halving | Every 6–24 months |

---

## 🧠 Key Insight
> Inflation should **reward loyalty**, not dilute holders.

If rewards are too high → token dumps.  
If rewards are too low → no one stakes.

---

## 🪙 Conclusion
A balanced staking inflation model attracts committed holders, secures the network, and improves token value over time. Each ecosystem should simulate multiple inflation schedules before deployment.
