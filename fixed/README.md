Fixed Supply Model

This folder explains the fixed token supply model, where all tokens are minted once and never increase.

Key points:

Total supply is constant

No minting after launch

Common in meme coins and store-of-value tokens

Promotes scarcity and long-term value stability


More examples and charts will be added later.
