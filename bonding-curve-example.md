## 🌀 Bonding Curve Example (Simple Token Model)

A bonding curve is a mathematical pricing system where the price of a token increases as more tokens are bought. This helps control supply and demand automatically using a formula.
### 📌 Linear Bonding Curve Formula
Price = m * Supply + b
Where:

m = slope (how fast price increases)

Supply = total number of tokens already issued

b = base price (starting price)
### 💰 Example Calculation

Let’s assume:

m = 0.01

b = 0.1

Current supply = 500 tokens
Price = 0.01 * 500 + 0.1
Price = 5 + 0.1
Price = 5.1 USDC per token
### 🏦 Why Bonding Curves Matter

✔ Helps avoid pump & dump
✔ Creates a fair launch
✔ Price moves based on network growth
✔ Works great for tokens, NFTs, DAOs & social tokens
### 🚀 Real Use Cases
